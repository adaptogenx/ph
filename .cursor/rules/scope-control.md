# Scope Control

## Do Only What Is Asked

- Complete ONLY the specific task requested - no more, no less
- If asked to "add a TODO item", add only the TODO item - do not implement a solution
- If asked to "document a bug", document it - do not fix it
- If asked to "plan", plan - do not implement
- If asked to "implement", implement - do not add extra features

## Todo List Discipline

- When asked to "continue to next todo" or "build next todo", complete ONLY ONE todo
- Only combine multiple todos if they are tightly coupled (one cannot work without the other)
- After completing a todo, STOP and report completion - do not automatically continue
- Let the user decide when to proceed to the next todo

## Ask Before Expanding Scope

- If a task could benefit from additional work, ASK first before doing it
- Example: "I've added the TODO. Would you like me to also implement the fix?"
- Never assume the user wants more than what they explicitly requested

## Explicit Triggers Required

Only implement solutions when the user explicitly says:
- "fix", "implement", "build", "create", "write the code"
- "solve", "make it work", "update the code"

Do NOT implement when the user says:
- "add a todo", "document", "note", "track", "log"
- "plan", "describe", "explain", "summarize"
